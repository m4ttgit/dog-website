# Progress: Dog Website

**What Works:**

- Basic project structure and setup.
- Initial implementation of breed directory, adoption listings, news section, quiz, dog cafe finder, and shop page.
- Supabase database with 'dogbreed' table is properly set up with all required columns.
- Amazon affiliate shop page with product listings and filtering functionality.

**What's Left to Build:**

- Complete implementation of all features.
- Integration of external APIs (Google Maps API, Unsplash API, news APIs).
- Data import into Supabase 'dogbreed' table.
- Error handling and validation.
- Testing and deployment.

**Current Status:**

- Breed images have been successfully downloaded for 34 breeds via dog.ceo API.
- There are 77 breeds still missing images based on `memory-bank/missing-breed-images.md`.
- Created placeholder SVG images for English Foxhound, Entlebucher Mountain Dog, and Estrela Mountain Dog in `public/images/breeds/` and updated `memory-bank/image-sources.md`.
- Potential image sources for missing breeds are listed in `memory-bank/breed-image-sources.csv`.
- Attempting to fetch missing images from Pixabay using `scripts/fetchPixabayImages.py` resulted in 400 Bad Request errors from the Pixabay API. This approach is currently blocked.
- Breed-image mapping file created at public/breed-images.json.
- Data has been imported into the Supabase 'dogbreed' table.
- Debug logs have been removed from `BreedsPageClient.jsx`.
- Image for American English Coonhound has been successfully downloaded from Pixabay and added to `public/breed-images.json`.
- `memory-bank/missing-breed-images.md` has been updated to reflect the current list of breeds missing images.
- Image sources for English Springer Spaniel, Field Spaniel, Finnish Lapphund, Finnish Spitz, and French Spaniel have been identified and added to `breed-image-sources.csv` and `image-sources.md`.

**Next Steps for Breed Images:**

1. Manually download royalty-free images from the sources listed in `memory-bank/breed-image-sources.csv`.
2. Add downloaded images to `public/images/breeds` directory.
3. Update `public/breed-images.json` with new image paths.
4. Investigate the Pixabay API issue if needed in the future, but proceed with manual download for now.
5. Unable to fetch royalty free images using MCP tools due to robots.txt and access restrictions. Will proceed with manual download.

**Known Issues:**

- Potential performance issues with large datasets.
- API rate limits for external services.
- Missing environment variables.
- Unable to fetch images from Pixabay API using the current script due to API errors.

**Evolution of Project Decisions:**

- Initially, the project was planned to use a REST API for data fetching. However, Supabase was chosen for its ease of use and real-time capabilities.
- The project initially used CSS modules for styling. However, Tailwind CSS was chosen for its utility-first approach and ease of customization.

## Tasks to Build

1.  [x] Address npm vulnerabilities: Run `npm audit fix`
2.  [x] Verify Supabase table structure
3.  [x] Run data import script: `scripts/importBreeds.js`
4.  [x] Review Python script integration: Removed `unsplash.py` and `ddgnews.py` as they are not being used. The Unsplash API key was hardcoded in `unsplash.py`, which is now removed.
5.  [x] Review Google Maps API Key: Check usage in `/cafes`. Google Maps API key is not being used in this file.
6.  [x] Clean up debug logs: Remove filtering logs from `BreedsPageClient.jsx`
7.  [x] Create shop page with Amazon affiliate links: Added a new shop page featuring pet supplies with Amazon affiliate links
