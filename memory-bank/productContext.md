# Product Context: Dog Website

**Why This Project Exists:**

This project aims to provide a centralized online resource for dog enthusiasts, addressing the need for comprehensive and easily accessible information about dog breeds, adoption, news, and local dog-friendly establishments.

**Problems It Solves:**

*   Scattered Information: Dog-related information is often scattered across various websites and sources, making it difficult for users to find what they need.
*   Lack of Centralized Adoption Listings: Finding adoptable dogs can be a time-consuming process, requiring users to browse multiple shelter websites.
*   Limited Awareness of Dog-Friendly Businesses: Dog owners often struggle to find cafes and restaurants that welcome their furry companions.

**How It Should Work:**

The website should offer a user-friendly interface with intuitive navigation, allowing users to easily browse breed information, search for adoptable dogs, stay updated on dog-related news, take a fun quiz, and locate dog-friendly cafes.

**User Experience Goals:**

*   Provide a visually appealing and engaging user experience.
*   Offer accurate and up-to-date information.
*   Facilitate easy navigation and search functionality.
*   Create a sense of community among dog lovers.
